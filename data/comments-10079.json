        "body": "Paraphrasing the internal email we are having on this subject:\r\n\r\nI believe this behavior is because the random input being fed to the model is not from a distribution that is representative of the distribution that was used to train the model. The scaling factor of 256 (input = np.random.rand(batch_size, 3, 480, 480)*256) seems to trigger overflows in InstanceNorm in the fp16 model. Ting has subsequently confirmed that feeding \"real\" images (with associated pre-processing) or even random inputs sampled from a distribution closer to the \"real\" distribution returns right results in fp16. There is no evidence to suggest that there is a problem with fp16 InstanceNorm at this stage.\r\n\r\n@yetingqiaqia : If you feel this explains the behavior, can you please close this issue ?  ",
