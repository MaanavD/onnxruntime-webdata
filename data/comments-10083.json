        "body": "So, if you create a model with just one node: maxpool, and use onnx to get the output shapes for the model. Then generate an input data, put them together in a format like the models in http://github.com/onnx/models.  The build onnxruntime and run the model with \"onnx_test_runner\". \r\n```\r\n./onnx_test_runner <model_dir>\r\n```\r\nThe tool will check if the output shapes matches. If not, it will report an error.  Then you give us the model and test data, I will find someone fix it. Is it ok? (Mostly likely it will be after the new year holiday). \r\n\r\n",
