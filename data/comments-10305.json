Most likely this is an issue with the transpose optimizer which runs in the 'basic' level, so you'd need to use ORT_DISABLE_ALL. \r\n\r\nWould be great if we could take a look at the model somehow to find out what's breaking. If an optimization is removing a node it first needs to remove the output edges. In this case that hasn't happened, leading to the exception. ",

It's a wrapper API so that the transpose optimizer can be plugged into other places (e.g. converters or a standalone tool to change the layout of a model). It's designed to support running on a subgraph - e.g. the NNAPI EP identifies a set of nodes if can run and we want to change the layout of those to NHWC.  \r\n\r\n`consumers->comprehensive = false;` should be set if implicit inputs are involved, and a node providing the implicit input should not be removed. It's possible there's a bug where that restriction is not correctly enforced. A model that fails would be helpful to identify if that is the case.",
