I was not responsible for compilation of Unity app but as far as I know Onnx Runtime library was compiled as any other additional library in C# for Unity. \r\nWe used this blogpost - [Add AI to mobile applications with Xamarin and ONNX Runtime](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2021/12/14/add-ai-to-mobile-applications-with-xamarin-and-onnx-runtime/) and the newest NuGet package of Onnx Runtime.\r\nHope this helps.",
