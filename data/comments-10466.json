Such execution providers depend on gen_def.py.\r\n2. Newer ones with entry points defined in onnxruntime_c_api.h as function pointers. like SessionOptionsAppendExecutionProvider_CUDA. These execution providers  do not need gen_def.py, and they can be loaded dynamically. \r\n\r\nSo, here the questions is: which way rocm wants to go? It would determine if rocm should be skipped in gen_def.py or not.",
