I feel that this has to be taken care of by the converter. \r\n\r\nAdding some converter folks to shed light on this - @wenbingl @jeffsaremi @jiafatom ",

Please open an issue in keras2onnx github repo to find out how to make the ONNX model support variable batch size.\r\n\r\nClosing this as this is not a runtime issue. Please re-open if you you have any concerns.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n  ",
