        "body": "@StayYouth1993: The device id passed to `OrtSessionOptionsAppendExecutionProvider_DML` just corresponds to the list of all GPU's that Windows DXGI returns from [IDXGIFactory::EnumAdapters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgifactory-enumadapters). On a machine with multiple GPU's, device id = 0 is typically the integrated GPU and id = 1 the discrete card (e.g. Intel for id 0, Nvidia for id 1), but depending on power settings I've seen it reversed, and so you'll want to pick the appropriate one for perf. Note you can also see this is Task Manager's Performance tab (GPU 0, GPU1). I'm unsure the best way to reach that C++ OS API from Python, but I found this [coalpy library](https://kecho.github.io/coalpy/coalpy.gpu.html) with a promising-sounding `get_adapters()` function, which [appears](https://github.com/kecho/coalpy/blob/fac994f43f588e2c65514be348fdac4efc6a6ea9/Source/modules/render/dx12/Dx12Device.cpp#L88) to call DXGI internally. Does that work for you?",
