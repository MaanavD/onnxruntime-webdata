        "body": "OnnxRuntime InferenceSession creates a threadpool with N/2 threads where N is the # of logic core by default. Python multiprocessing.Pool spawns multiple processes. Multiple processes mean multiple sessions and multiple threadpool. Too many threadpools will comp hurt performance. \r\nIn almost all scenarios you need only one process and multiple threads to parallelize inferences. The Run() function is designed to be run concurrently from multiple threads. So the workflow would look like - create one session and then call Run using this session from multiple threads.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to try tuning throughput with multiple processes, you can limit the number of # of threads with setting of intra_op_num_threads, for example, setting intra_op_num_threads = 1 and start N processes.
