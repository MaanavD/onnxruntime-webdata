        "body": "there are 3 reasons for not setting this to 'true' by default.\r\n\r\nthe first reason is for backward compatibility. some users do not expect to have a new web worker created without any code change.\r\n\r\nthe second reason is that for some small models, the inference time is very small so that does not hurt the main thread performance. instead, using a proxy in this scenario will increase the latency (there is anyway overhead)\r\n\r\nthe third reason is we have a plan to make onnxruntime web available in web worker (ie. similar to your idea; something like `importScript('./ort.min.js')`. currently this is not supported yet), which eventually supports more flexible usages in different scenarios, so using proxy is one of the options that users can choose from.",

        "body": "@fs-eire, do you have usage data/feedback which supports your second point? I'd guess that this is not the case for most users. IIRC, a `postMessage` takes less than a millisecond (unless the data is huge - but in that case transferable objects should help keep it on the order of a few milliseconds at most).\r\n\r\nRE your first point, I wouldn't have thought that the creation of a webworker would be a breaking change, since it seems like just an implementation detail that can't break existing code (though it could slow it down by a millisecond or so for some users - RE your second point).\r\n\r\nIIUC, the third point doesn't preclude the proxy mode from being the default.\r\n\r\nThinking about this from a user experience perspective, I think it makes sense for the defaults to match what the vast majority of users would want. If you have data/feedback to suggest that most users have models that inference in just a few milliseconds (and have super low latency as a strong requirement), then I think the current situation is a good default, but if not (and if you can't change it for v1), then I hope you'll consider changing it for v2. Otherwise, please feel free to close this.\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply!",
