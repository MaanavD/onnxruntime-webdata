I tried loading the model and I hit the same error message (at load time, not at inference run time)\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems to be in the batch dimension - it seems to have both the symbolic dimension (for processing a batch of inputs) and also a '1' denoting that it can only process 1 input per inference run - \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9969784/58658765-1cd76080-82d6-11e9-93a8-667e7f6707b1.png)\r\n\r\nThe right input dimenions would have to be [Sequence, 3, 480, 640] (in this case a batch of input values can be processed) or [1, 3, 480, 640] (in this case only a single input can be processed) - but the exported model has both, which I am guessing was not intended.\r\n\r\nThis is either:\r\n *  bug in the exporter logic \r\n   (or)\r\n *  an incorrect configuration specified at export time\r\n\r\nPlease raise a issue in the appropriate forum (in this case it's probably the CNTK to ONNX exporter forum) and once the correction is made in the model, we can proceed to actually running the (correct version of the) model using ORT.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\n",

The problem is that the exported model has both symbolic dimension (Sequence) and '1' for the batch dimension. So the input dimension becomes [Sequence, 1, 3, 480, 640] instead of [Sequence, 3, 480, 640] or [1, 3, 480, 640]. \r\n\r\nIs there a quick solution from the converter side to convert the existing CNTK model directly into ONNX (as opposed to being loaded in CNTK and then exported to ONNX) for unblocking model run ?
