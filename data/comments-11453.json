        "body": "Right. Currently, we do not support ALL types for ALL operators in the ONNX standard to keep binary size in check. For Conv, it seems like we only support float - https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/2a90922f01e2fa9861dda0c7a769cfed09658167/onnxruntime/core/providers/cpu/nn/conv.cc#L306. You can add support for double similar to the line I referenced and build from source. \r\n\r\nIf there is enough interest for CPU Conv requiring double type support from the community, it may be added in a future release.
