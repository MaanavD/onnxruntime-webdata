You can refer to it: https://github.com/fs-eire/ort-rn-hello-world\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that onnxruntime-react-native does not work with expo managed workflow because it contains native module. I am not expert of expo/react-native so I am not sure if there is a way to solve this problem. So far it works with the bare workflow (using `expo prebuild` and update the android/ios project files).",
