I do not recommend anyone uses pip to fetch ORT package there, because it has a high risk of supply chain security issue. \r\n\r\nSorry I won't fix it. Please build ORT from source if you really need to use a nightly package. Or, please contact my PM. \r\n\r\nAt this moment, due to Microsoft security polices, I don't have a solution for this except directly publishing the nightly packages to pypi.org.\r\n",
