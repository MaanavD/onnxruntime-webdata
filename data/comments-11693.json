        "body": "Because, when I added the code the machine even doesn't have GCC. I wanted to use it to simulate end users experience. I thought ORT must be compatible with the latest released version of ONNX. Because We couldn't expect every user knew how to build protobuf and ONNX python package from source.  It's tough.\r\nHowever, on the other hand, ORT python package doesn't take dependency on onnx python package. So it seems only we care if the two packages are compatible or not, the end users do not.  As they don't depend on each other, usually there wouldn't be compatibility issues either.  So... does it matter? ",
