        "body": "The memory allocated by ORT's session is not just a function of the input image's size but also a function of the model itself (as the weights/initializers need to be allocated as well). That said, 20GB after session creation + one Run() seems excessive unless you have a model that is pretty large. It would help people commenting on this thread to paste some code.\r\n\r\nSome other things to try:\r\n\r\n1) The weights are allocated by an arena and it is possible that the arena has grown quite a bit and the memory is fragmented that it requires more allocations during the Run() itself. If you are using the C/C++ API, you can configure the session such that the weights are not allocated by the arena (https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/5ecfaef042380995fb15587ccf6ff77f9d3a01d2/onnxruntime/test/shared_lib/test_inference.cc#L1869). This way any memory fragmentation because of arena growth while allocating initializers is avoided.\r\n\r\n2) The arena growth itself is by default pretty aggressive, so you can try configuring it to grow less aggressively during Run() (at the cost of potentially making more allocation calls): https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/5ecfaef042380995fb15587ccf6ff77f9d3a01d2/onnxruntime/test/shared_lib/test_inference.cc#L1885 (\"arena_extend_strategy\" -> \"1\").\r\n",
