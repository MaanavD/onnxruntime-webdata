The only difference that I spotted is the version (1.8.1), which is quite out-of-dated (current master is 1.12). If there is no strong reason to stay on 1.8.1, could you try do the same steps on latest code? If you want to use 1.8.1, could you try do the build with some older nodejs version (like version LTS 14)?",
