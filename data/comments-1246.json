        "body": "Hi @xprotobeast2,\r\n\r\nThe warnings are just to warn you that one ( and possibly more ) 'Unsqueeze' node(s) were assigned to be executed on CPU (as opposed to the GPU). This makes sense as the [unsqueeze operator](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#Unsqueeze) itself doesn't involve any logic to operate on the input data and it just modifies metadata (tensor dimensions) so there is no point is copying tensor data over to the GPU, make a copy, and then return back the copied contents to the CPU. I do not see an issue with this as such.\r\n\r\nPlease close this issue unless you need more clarifications.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
