        "body": "Hi @tracysh,\r\n\r\nYour hit is helpful. Please allow me elaborate more.\r\n\r\nFor cmake and VS, there are two ways to specify architecture(32 bits or 64)\r\n\r\n1. (new) cmake -A x64 -G \"Visual Studio 15 2017\"\r\n2. (old) cmake -G \"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64\"\r\n\r\nEverybody today should use the new one.\r\nThe old one, in most projects other than onnxruntime, should continue to work.
