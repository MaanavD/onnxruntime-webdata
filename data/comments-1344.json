Does a clean build fix the error? Delete all output folders , and also remove any stale  OnnxRuntime packages in the NuGet cache folder. The NuGet cache folder location varies -- for .NetFramework projects, all DLLs are copied to a folder called **packages** alongside your project. For .NetCore projects, they are stored centrally under C:\\Users\\username\\\\.nuget\\packages folder. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
