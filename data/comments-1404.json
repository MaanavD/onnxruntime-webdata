For some reason ngraph.dll is not being included in the Windows wheel, so, as a stopgap, would you add the place in your build directory where ngraph.dll is located to your PATH environment variable?  With that, python should be able to load the library.  (Alternatively, copy ngraph.dll to a directory listed in your PATH)",

I believe (please @jywu-msft  correct me if I'm wrong) that most documented use cases of the onnxruntime through python make use of the DEX mode of operation (and equivalent in other EPs).\r\n\r\nSorry for the length of the reply, I hope this information is useful and goes some ways towards answering your question.",

        "body": "> @137996047 , as far as I understand, ngraph can work in one of two modes: \"DEX\", or \"direct execution\", where a DL model is executed by the onnxruntime/ngraph runtime (I tend to think of it as immediate mode in a graphics library, or an interpreter), and \"codegen\" mode, where the DL model is not executed, but \"translated\" into an executable format, which can then be executed without the need of the whole runtime (in the previous analogy, this would be, roughly, like retained mode or a compiler). I believe (please @jywu-msft correct me if I'm wrong) that most documented use cases of the onnxruntime through python make use of the DEX mode of operation (and equivalent in other EPs).\r\n> \r\n> Sorry for the length of the reply, I hope this information is useful and goes some ways towards answering your question.\r\n\r\nThank you for your explain, I think I get it.\r\nTo summarize, When we built onnxruntime using ngraph, if we encounter such an error,  we can try copying `cpu_backend.dll`,  `ngraph.dll` and `tbb.dll` in `\\build\\Windows\\RelWithDebInfo\\RelWithDebInfo\\onnxruntime\\capi` to `C:\\Users\\user_name\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\anaconda2\\envs\\onx_graph\\Lib\\site-packages\\onnxruntime\\capi`. \r\n",
