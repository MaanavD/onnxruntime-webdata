Ideally you'd make use of the v-extension but that's still a wip.\r\n\r\nFor other architectures, so long as your target platform has a c++ compiler it should just compile fine, although you'll probably want to create your own provider backend to take advantage of vectorization.\r\n\r\nI'm maintaining a [fork](https://github.com/pranav-prakash/onnxruntime-riscv) that works on riscv. It also supports the [gemmini](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09925) matmul accelerator (a rocc co-processor).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
