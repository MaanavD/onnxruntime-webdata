This is leaking your implementation details out to the user for no benefit to the user.\r\n\r\nI had created an array of serialized proto tensors in Python with `numpy_helper.from_array(data)` and `file.write(tensor.SerializeToString())`, for testing the C API out. But in production we wouldn't be serializing to proto tensor format, and would use `OrtCreateTensorWithDataAsOrtValue`.\r\n\r\nThanks for clarifying, but since you removed this function altogether I suppose the issue can just be closed :) ",
