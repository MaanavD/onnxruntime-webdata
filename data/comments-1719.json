And I need to script to try and repro.\r\n\r\n2) Also, this is a vanilla test case for Resize op. I am surprised it is failing. I think there must be some other issue that isn't easily visible. Please provide these details to investigate further - \r\n   Which version of ORT are you using? \r\n   Is it the CPU or GPU package? \r\n   And which platform are you running the script ? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",
