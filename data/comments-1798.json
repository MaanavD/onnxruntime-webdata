The inputs variable in the your code above should contain a list of inputs that the model expects for that 1 example being scored, not a list of examples to construct a batch.\r\n\r\nThe notion of batch size (if a model can handle batches) is captured by the tensor shapes  For example, if the shape of a tensor is [N, C, H, W], N is the number of images (batch size), C is number of channels, H is height of the image, W is the width of the image.",
