I also checked there is a `sess_options.session_log_verbosity_level` which is more related to this issue, but it only useful with a debug build.\r\nNow if you could provide a way to get nightly builds with pip something like:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install --pre torch torchvision -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu100/torch_nightly.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat would be great. Also, setting `log_verbosity_level=-1` I still did not see logs",
