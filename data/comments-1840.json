        "body": "Hi @dashesy,\r\n\r\nThis maybe a useful enhancement but this issue is for the ONNX repo and for the ONNX community to accept it and if accepted this op can be enhanced in its next version.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, the current 'Expand' implementation in ORT adheres to spec in not allowing negative values as the op spec states that it is similar to `numpy.broadcast_to()` (with the minor exception which is documented). numpy.broadcast_to does not accept `-1` in its shape. Also the op states that the functionality of the op is `numpy.array(input) * numpy.ones(shape)` and we can't feed in negative values for the shape in this case either. \r\n\r\nSo, this seems specific to Torch and this one should be raised in ONNX and if accepted - ORT can support it.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",
