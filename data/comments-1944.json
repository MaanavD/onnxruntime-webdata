        "body": "Hi @abduld ,\r\n\r\nExpanding on the answer, if you open-up the model using Netron (or any other tool) and examine the graph inputs, usually a model that natively supports \"batching\" has symbolic dimensions in the graph input shape descriptions. For example, like this - \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9969784/65905177-eccbc700-e374-11e9-91fe-f643c88a3a7b.png)\r\n\r\nA model that doesn't usually has the input shape fixed like [1, 224, 224, 3].\r\n\r\nClosing this issue as this is not an issue for ORT. \r\n\r\nPleas re-open for further clarifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
