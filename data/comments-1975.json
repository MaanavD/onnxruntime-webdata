        "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI think there are 2 dimensions to this issue:\r\n\r\n1) I think when you feed it random data, the model is unable to make any detections\r\n2) When the C# layer tries to create a tensor with no elements (number of detection boxes = 0), it throws. In Python, I get back an empty array of shape [0, 4].\r\n\r\nSo, please try following the demo in the link you pasted and try inferencing on an image where the model is sure to detect something. In legitimate cases when there is an image with no objects (or one that the model isn't able to detect), the C# layer must be able to handle it (addressed by #1976 ) ",
