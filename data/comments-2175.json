        "body": "Hi Luan,\r\n\r\nDid you convert this model from MxNet by any chance ? It has the same issue as the ArcFace model where the BN nodes are stamped with spatial == 0 and the inputs (scale, B, mean, var) do not conform to ONNX spec - \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9969784/67127575-82a58580-f1ae-11e9-82e0-0d99761ed912.png)\r\n\r\nThe input shape [3] is acceptable only when spatial == 1. As it is, this is an invalid ONNX model. Please try using the script I shared in the ArcFace model issue to correct this model and try again.\r\n\r\nClosing this, because it is an invalid ONNX opset-8 model.\r\n",
