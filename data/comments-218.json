        "body": "The default [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) is **r\"(?u)\\b\\w\\w+\\b\"**, which can be achieved by putting **\"\\u\"** and **\"\\b\"** to the separator list of the current tokenizer. I am not sure how popular customized regular expression is, but I never touched that attribute by myself. In addition, I am not confident that supporting regexp is good to runtime because it has no standard and varies from library to library. Could we still use native separator list to mimic **r\"(?u)\\b\\w\\w+\\b\"** until seeing some strong feedbacks from users? @yuanbyu, do you have any comments here? \r\n\r\n[Update] Just got another idea. Maybe we can use regex in standard C++ to define token/stopword and the converter can convert Python regexp to C++ one.",
