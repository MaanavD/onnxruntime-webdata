Hence it's quite possible that an onnx model might not work on the EPs directly. ORT implements the full ONNX standard and guarantees to execute your model even if EPs cannot do so. It does this by falling back on the CPU implementation of ops. Please read the design doc for more details.\r\n\r\n> * How is onnx runtime different from TVM Compiler?\r\nORT is an inferencing runtime. TVM is a compiler for DNNs. Different objectives.\r\n\r\nAlso, please open a new issue if you've any further questions/clarifications.\r\n",
