        "body": "The  current code is relying on the [OrtFillStringTensor API](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/csharp/src/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime/NativeMethods.cs#L592) to do  encoding of managed C# strings (in UTF-16) and fill out a native ORT tensor (in UTF-8). However, it seems this API doesn't work in all cases.\r\n\r\nThe unit test needs to be updated to include more complex characters in string values, beyond the simple ASCII-compatible characters currently being used, and verify that the string values faithfully complete a round trip going from “Input C# string --> C# ORT layer --> Native ORT --> C# ORT layer --> output C# string” without being mangled (e.g. using an ONNX model whose output is an \"echo\" of the input).\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to update [OrtFillStringTensor API](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/csharp/src/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime/NativeMethods.cs#L592)  to handle more complex strings (e.g. multi-byte, non-ASCII-compatible).\r\n\r\nA second solution would be to do all encoding to UTF-8 in C#, and compose native string tensors programatically, without using OrtFillStringTensor.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
