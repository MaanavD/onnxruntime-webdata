(The model would fail even with the CPU ORT package - not just with the GPU package.)\r\n\r\nHere is the spec of the OneHot op - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#OneHot\r\n\r\nThe `indices` input of the OneHot op is of shape {1, 32, 704, 1280} and the `depth` is 1280 too and axis = 3. So per spec the output shape of the OneHot op is: {1, 32, 704, **1280**, 1280}. This is an INT64 tensor. Roughly this translates to about 1 * 32 * 704 * 1280 * 1280 * 8 bytes of memory. This is a lot of memory being requested and doesn't seem realistic.\r\n\r\nSo, even though the model is \"valid\" and the runtime has no bugs that the model run is triggering, the memory request is just too unrealistic. I think the model has not been exported correctly. Please check with the project/framework using which this ONNX model has been generated.\r\n\r\nClosing this out as this is not an ORT issue. Please re-open for more clarifications.\r\n\r\nP.S. For the next time, it would be great if you could please zip up the model file and just upload it here in the comments section.\r\n",
