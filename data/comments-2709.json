        "body": "Is it possible for you to use a different model? For example, inception_v3 or v4, you can get instructions from https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/samples/c_cxx/imagenet and I've verified the accuracy is correct. \r\n\r\nThe inception_v2 issue reported by you is most likely because the image preprocessing isn't right.  The model you used was converted from caffe2, and the author provided a set of test data there, onnxruntime passed the test.  So, onnxruntime itself should be correct.  You may contact the caffe2/pytorch team to get more info on this model. (e.g. how to do the preprocessing).\r\n\r\nAnother option is: you may get the inception_v2 model converted from [TF](https://www.tensorflow.org/). However, there is a tiny bug either in the converter side or in onnxruntime. We need help from the tensorflow converter team to get it fixed. (FYI @faxu)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
