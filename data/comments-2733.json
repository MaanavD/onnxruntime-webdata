        "body": "@jywu-msft: Thanks. There wasn't any plan or requirement. I just thought I would try and address this open issue which basically asks for this feature. I had the same apprehension because numpy array comes bound to a specific type whereas python list objects may basically contain anything and need to be handled with care. The logic in the PR basically tries to parse the provided list based on the type specified by the TypeProto for the specific input failing which, it throws. I see both sides to this - it does seem reasonable o support it especially if other popular frameworks like scikit support it, whereas numpy arrays do seem safer to handle for regular tensors (especially when ONNX supports an inherent sequence tensor type). Anyway, I ll keep the PR open in case, someone wants to use the logic. Thanks! ",
