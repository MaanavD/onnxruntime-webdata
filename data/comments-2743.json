        "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nIt looks like there has been MxNet to ONNX conversion issues. \r\n\r\nThe error message basically means there is an operator in the computation graph that has inputs/attributes bound to different types (float and double in this case), when it is supposed to be the same type. I don't know which specific operator is affected, but as an illustrative example - let's take the And op (https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#and). And has 2 inputs A and B bound to type T (which means the types of A and B need to be the same and one of the supported types for T). I would recommend opening an issue in the relevant MxNet-ONNX coverter project with the converted ONNX model.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, do you have the latest ONNX release ? This commit in ONNX - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/commit/ca1d5b7e0a3290a1419cb2020511df07d11287fe, should have checks for exactly this scenario (types not being homogeneous) and should have failed at the onnx model checking stage.
