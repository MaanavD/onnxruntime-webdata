As I see it, get_device() in python returns a macro that is formed when the Py package is built (the macro is constructed based on the build options). We could have a similar logic for the C/C++ interface.\r\n\r\nI don't see why the other 2 (Model metadata struct and the end_profiling() API) cannot be exposed right now either.\r\n\r\nThoughts @snnn @pranavsharma  ?

        "body": "Hi @ankane \r\n\r\nFetching the `ModelMetadata` and `end_profiling()`are supported via #2794 . I spoke to some folks and they say that the global method `get_device()` was apparently added only to support the onnx backend API (https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/onnx/backend/base.py) and is Python only. I think what you may have bee interested in is something along the lines of the `GetAvailableProviders()` in the C API and as @snnn mentions there are plans to support adding new execution provider with changing onnxruntime's existing code and hence supporting that API may not be the right way forward now. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can close this issue after the PR is merged. Thanks!",

It sounds like `GetAvailableProviders()` will return similar info, and it's also used to determine fallback providers in Python. There's also `GetRegisteredProviderTypes()` which is used to implement the `get_providers()` method on `onnxruntime.InferenceSession`.\r\n\r\nTotally understand if there are concerns with exposing provider APIs.
