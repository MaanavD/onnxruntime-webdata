This would mean that the shape to be reshaped when the graph input is {1,1,244,204} would probably be (going based on the pattern) {1,9,244,204} and this reshape request can be executed. \r\n\r\nWhen the graph input shape is {1,1,444,204} and if the reshape request in the exported ONNX graph is still {-1,1,3,3,244,204} (which is what I think is happening), it would fail on the error message shown above.\r\n\r\nCould you please open a bug in the PyTorch repo with these findings ? It seems like the 'dynamic_axis' aspect is not being honored, but rather the exporter seems to be working for fixed input shapes.\r\n\r\n",
