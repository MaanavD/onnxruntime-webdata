When you delay-load a DLL, you have less control when the DLL will be unloaded. In our case, it may result crashes when the process is ending.  So we gave it up. \r\n\r\n2. [Explicit Linking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/linking-an-executable-to-a-dll?view=vs-2019).  It should work fine, but it need significant work. \r\n\r\nSo, if you ask me again, \"Is this behavior intentional?\"\r\n\r\nI have to say: Yes, for now.\r\n",
