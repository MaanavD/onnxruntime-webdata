        "body": "Thanks for the report. The bug is caused by the NCHWc layout optimizer. This graph has every internal node output also be a graph output. The optimizer wasn't accounting for this. I have a fix I've tested out and the graph loads successfully. I'll push that PR out tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWith this though, there will be extra CPU cycles spent to reorder buffers for each of the convolution and pooling nodes. If the graph outputs could be reduced to just the needed output, that would improve inference time when using this optimization.",
