        "body": "@yufenglee @zhanghuanrong The implementation of DequantizeLinear is overly complicated: it has support for an axis attribute that doesn't exist in the ONNX spec. This is probably based on the old QuantizeLinear implementation in the com.ms namespace that also had an axis attribute. In this case, the input tensor is a scalar and the \"broadcastDim=x_shape[axis]\" faults. This could be fixed by stripping out all the axis code. Something one of you wants to fix?",

        "body": "@vuvko A fix for this has been checked into master. Thanks for reporting the problem!\r\n\r\nA couple comments about your model: you may want to run the model through an ONNX optimizer before quantizing. This will allow the Conv+BatchNormalization nodes to be fused. Also, you may now see better performance using QLinearOps as the quantization mode.\r\n\r\nAs things currently stand, the model will be switching between quantized and float formats to do LeakyRelu. The runtime still needs to implement a quantized LeakyRelu to further streamline the model.",
