        "body": "A call to EndProfiling() is required for the events to get written to the profile file - https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/edd5855fb7b7ed9e66c48d6fb2816ea7b4b8e068/onnxruntime/core/session/inference_session.h#L323. The reason why you were seeing events written when you were coding with using() {...} is that `using`  disposes the InferenceSession at the end of the block and the Dispose() method triggers destruction of the native InferenceSession which in its destructor calls EndProfiling() - https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/edd5855fb7b7ed9e66c48d6fb2816ea7b4b8e068/onnxruntime/core/session/inference_session.cc#L297.\r\n\r\nLooks like we need to expose `EndProfiling`  as a CSharp API to support the non-using() {...} use-case.
