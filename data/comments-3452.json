I am also waiting for this PR until I integrate with ONNXRuntime.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/5d99f179b9aad05d6fc5f1fe7565b40788709b21/include/onnxruntime/core/framework/kernel_def_builder.h#L67\r\n\r\nThe main change is you can now specify what device the input and output will be on. So, for instance, you can pick a device that is *not* a CPU.",
