Maybe try either a `deque` or perhaps `vector<uint8_t>` and then casting to a bool?",

Using `vector<uint8_t>` allows me to create the data I need and then using a `reinterpret_cast<bool*>` on the `uint8_t*` pointer that comes out of calling `bool_data.data()` when passing this into `Ort::Value::CreateTensor<bool>` allows the model to get tensors in the right type.",
