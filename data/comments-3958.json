        "body": "@pranavsharma Is it too much effort to add this, or is there a fundamental problem in bringing this feature to a standalone python API? This would be really interesting and helpful addition as onnx-runtime would be totally decoupled from custom ops and developers would be really empowered with quickly trying new custom ops without having to go through the cumbersome build process. \r\n \r\nCan you also point to project files for creating a stand-alone custom-op dynamic library on windows?",
