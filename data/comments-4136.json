        "body": "Right, the file is about 548 MB, and protobuf need 2x to 3x memory to load a file, so you'll need about 1.5GB memory in a 32 bits process. Due to memory fragment/address space reserved by hardware,  it's hard to get it. But, please don't put blame on protobuf. ONNX had a bad design at the beginning, protobuf isn't designed for large messages.  ONNX should only use protobuf to keep the metadata(without tensor weights) or divide the whole data into smaller pieces(like 2MB for each).  Protobuf is a message format, not a file format. ONNX should have another layer on top of it.",
