        "body": "@Craigacp: This is not caused by invalid domain string. I tried another model with some random domain string and it works fine. The issue is caused by your Imputer node, which should have some input, but in your model there is no input to this node. So, the input tensor type is \"undefined\", which is not handled when mapping the input type to enum in ONNX and hence causes SIGSEGV.\r\nThis looks an invalid model, how did you generate the model? Did you use skl2onnx?",
