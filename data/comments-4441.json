So it is not available on Linux. \r\n\r\nI suggest you may create a simplified sample reader. Basically, you should have a thread pool, which read and decode image files in multiple threads, and put the results in a queue. The sample reader is the producer of the queue, you should have another thread pool that consumes the queue and invoke ORT functions to run the inference. ",
