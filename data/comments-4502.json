        "body": "Feels like doing this during partitioning is overly complicated and may not be the right place to address the issue as it's unknown whether choosing a single CPU based implementation would always be worse or not. Depending on the device or the complexity of the function the best choice may differ and the EP author may be the only one able to say for sure which should be chosen.\r\n\r\nInstead maybe there should be a convenient setup for the EP author to register a kernel that executes the function based operator using the constituent operators. Not sure what would be required to set that up. @codemzs may have a better idea how hard this would be to do. ",
