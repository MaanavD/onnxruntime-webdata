There is no benefit of doing this except it may save a few hundred KBs disk space, but it will create more trouble to you. \r\n\r\nIts not about diskspace, its about packaging and security. When there is an security issue with protobuf for example and the standard static compiled ONNXRUNTIME is used, this security issue:\r\na)  is not visible for a user and\r\nb) can't be fixed by simply updating protobuf\r\nbut ONNXRUNTIME has to be recompiled and reinstalled. \r\nThe same holds true for any issues with ONNX itself.\r\n\r\n> Think about this, what if ONNX released a new version, but onnxruntime hasn't? How will you cooperate this?\r\n\r\nThe common solution for this is using not libonnx.so.${version} so that different versions of the same library can exists on a system. Unfortunately ONNX does not support this.\r\nMy question is now, will it be possible to use an unpatched versions of ONNX in the future? So is there a chance that the proto files from ONNXRUNTIME will be used in ONNX?\r\nOr is it possible to rename the ONNX part during the build. I already tried that by changing the namespace in \r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/cf92497c160b3a72ae663ab4dd9cd818331b62db/cmake/onnx/CMakeLists.txt#L45\r\nand renaming the libraries in that file, but did not succeed. Do you think this is possible?\r\n\r\n",
