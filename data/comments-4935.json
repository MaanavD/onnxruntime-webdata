        "body": "For me I'm not using any K80 at this point personally, although I do still found their active use in academical environment.\r\n\r\nSample deployments there're still alive:\r\n- https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/chameleon\r\n- https://rcc.uchicago.edu/support-and-services/midway2\r\n- https://xstream.stanford.edu/specs/\r\n- https://www.marcc.jhu.edu/hardware/\r\n- https://wiki.gacrc.uga.edu/wiki/GPU_Hardware\r\n\r\nAnd Cloud providers, including us, are still having K80 as well:\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nc-series\r\n- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/\r\n\r\nSo from deployment point of view, Kepler works way better than Fermi and gained a huge installation base at that time, it may not be decommissioned that quickly.\r\nBut once that's \"gone\", we can probably fast-forward to Pascal since Maxwell is just a transitional product.\r\n\r\nRegarding whether to keep supporting K80, my suggestions would be:\r\n\r\n- See if support with trt7 can be kept for a while, if so K80 user can simply stick to the old version.\r\n- Check for library compatibility inside cmake, when user is trying to compile for sm35/sm37, and provide clear error msg if it doesn't work.\r\n- Upon removal of the support, create a rock-solid version as the last version so that K80 use can still have something to fallback to.\r\n\r\nRegarding timing:\r\n\r\nTesla K80 was launched in Nov 2014, < 7 years ago, and it's quite reasonable to ask for 10-year support on a professional hardware.\r\nSo IMO nvidia is not doing a great job here, for deprecating sm35/sm37 in driver that early.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can also talk to Azure teams to see how long do they plan to keep those NC-series machines?",
