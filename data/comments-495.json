        "body": "Hi @lynic  \r\n\r\nIt turns out the output shape generated by the runtime is quite valid according to the ONNX spec. For a precedent, please check out the test `averagepool_2d_precomputed_same_upper` in ONNX. It has auto_pad = \"SAME_UPPER\" and strides > 1 (non-default) and the expected output dimension value contains a value lower than the corresponding input dimension value.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is like this - \r\n\r\n1) When an autopad value of \"SAME_UPPER\" or \"SAME_LOWER\", pads are first computed so that the entire kernel can be accommodated even when operating on a border pixel (\"SAME_UPPER\"  and \"SAME_LOWER\" only differ in minor details dictating the distribution of pads to the front and end of the dimension)\r\n\r\n2) The output shape is then computed as this: floor(((in_size - kernel + total_padding) / stride)) +1. For the special case of stride == 1, the output shape is the same as the input shape, not otherwise.\r\n\r\nReferences:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37674306/what-is-the-difference-between-same-and-valid-padding-in-tf-nn-max-pool-of-t  (I particluary liked the third answer :))\r\n\r\nPlease re-open this issue if further clarification is required. \r\n\r\nAlso, please follow the answers here - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/1921. I raised this question after seeing the test mentioned above, but I later did some research to find that the test is quite valid, but it might be worthwhile to follow the explanation given by the Deep Learning experts.\r\n\r\ncc: @pranavsharma  ",
