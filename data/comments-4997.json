There is an 'Equal' node that seems to consume an output of a 'Size' node (which according to the onnx spec produces only int64 output - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#Size) and the other input to 'Equal' seems to be int32 which makes it an invalid onnx model as the input types to 'Equal' need to be homogeneous - \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9969784/91826249-2abf1400-ebf2-11ea-98c7-c46ec4c79ded.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nMost likely a 'Cast' node was missed at the output of 'Size'.
