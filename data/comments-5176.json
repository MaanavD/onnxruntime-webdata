The performances (latencies) are immediately **perfect** when to pod **startup**, with about **250 MB** of resident memory usage.\r\n\r\nAfter **few days** and (each model being \"reloaded\" daily), each pod reach **1GB** of resident memory usage, and keep growing (because of redeploy and kubernetes memory limits, I never reached any \"approximate flat line\" of memory usage)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just look forward to **maintain a memory usage at about 250 MB**.\r\n\r\nI saw a memory related feature in the freshly released version [1.5.1](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/tag/v1.5.1) : \r\n\r\n> Sharing of allocators between multiple sessions.
