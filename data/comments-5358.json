While the original RetinaNet model may support variable batch size, and H and W.\r\nit looks like the model that was exported/converted and uploaded to the onnx model zoo is only supporting batch size of 1. H of 480 and W of 640\r\nif you examine the input shape of the model (for example using netron)\r\nyou'll see the input shape is hardcoded to [1,3,480,640]\r\n\r\nnormally if the model supports dynamic batch, then you can just feed onnxruntime_perf_test a tensor with batch dimension > 1.\r\nthe tool has no notion of \"batch size\", it just accepts whatever tensor that you feed it. (the tensor itself can represent batches of input data)\r\n",
