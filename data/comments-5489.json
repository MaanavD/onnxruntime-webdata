        "body": "hi @Monah84, based on your description it seems the issue is more suited under the huggingface repo, since your ask is to extend the original model inputs dtype with torch.str. \r\nThat being said, are you looking for str type because the input you have is raw sentences in string? If so you should use the tokenizer to preprocess the string into token ids. ",

        "body": "Yes, you are right. It confused me since during calling the predict function, It accepts raw string. But, when I converted it to onnx, it does not. I managed to convert the raw string to tokens using the tokenizer. Now, I am trying to figure out why the predict function returns array of float \"probability\" and not array of 0 and 1 for the multi-label classification.\r\n\r\nThank you for the reply, it was very helpful ",
