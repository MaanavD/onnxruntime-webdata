        "body": "@wangyems I reproduced the crash: the crash is in ReshapeFusion::Match_One_Element_Output_Subgraph_2. The model is using opset 6 where Slice had the start/end as attributes, not inputs. The logic needs to be updated to read the attributes for older opsets (or stop matching Slice-1).\r\n\r\n@EnricoBeltramo The model was exported from an older version of pytorch where the default ONNX opset was version 6. If optimizations are disabled, the model will still fail to run because the runtime doesn't support BatchNormalization-6. The model needs to be exported with at least opset version 7, and updating to opset version 11 would avoid the above bug. See the opset_version parameter to torch.onnx.export.",
