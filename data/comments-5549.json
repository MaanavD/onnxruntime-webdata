        "body": "ONNX Dropout operation during inferencing is generally a no-op (i.e.) it is just like the Identity operation where-in it produces an output which is the same as the input (with nothing dropped out). I see that they support an input called `training_mode` which is a boolean tensor and feeding it a `true` should have inputs randomly dropout (based on the ratio). Looking at the spec, there should be nothing preventing users from using the `training_mode` flavor of the operator while inferencing if that is truly desired. So, you could pass in a bool tensor (with value as true) to try and get the dropout going while inferencing. (https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#Dropout)\r\n\r\nNot sure about the samentics of the model export to ONNX from Torch though (i.e.) not sure if setting training = TrainingMode.TRAINING will affect other aspects of the model graph. This is probably a question for the exporter project.",
