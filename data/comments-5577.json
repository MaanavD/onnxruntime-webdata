        "body": "\"I think the sample means that the session itself do not care the shape of the input, just set the input_tensor the proper shape with the batchsize,\" - That is true but your model should also support it. In this case, your model does not - it is not flexible in its requirement - it expects batch size to be 1 and you provided 4.\r\n\r\nUsually the model input has a \"dynamic\" shape for the batch dimension (see https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/2118 https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/1944).  I think some frameworks (Torch for example) support exporting the model with \"dynamic\" input shape requirements that can be used for batched inferencing.",
