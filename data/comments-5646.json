After looking at the way you preparing the input, I think the cause is that the input shape is not align with what onnx model requires. e.g. There are a couple of inputs that require float32[batch, 12, sequence, 64], you need to make sure that the actual inputs share the same batch number and sequence number. This seems not a framework issue.",

My assumption was that due to the transpose operation the shapes are re-arranged and as mentioned in the error a buffer with the previously used shape is attempted to be re-used which is causing the error.\r\nIs that not so?",

If you fix this, the buffer reuse issue may still occur but it's non-blocking. It may be due to that your model have some initializers serving as both input and output. Please check if your model looks as you expected.",

This is all a theory which might actually point to a bug in the exporting code where the output shape doesn't matter for dynamic axes.\r\nIt would be great if you could comment on this!\r\nThanks",

The concept of dynamic axis is like a variable - any inputs shapes that use this variable will share the same value during inferencing. So if those values are not the same then the dynamic variable shall not be considered. Regarding your export question, you may want to take a look at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html and see if it answers your question.",
