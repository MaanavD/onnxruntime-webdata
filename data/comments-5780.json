It looks like it's not present in the internal `ModelMetadata` struct that all the ONNX Runtime APIs use. It is on the inner model object itself, so it could be exposed up through the C API to everyone, but that involves changing more of the internals which probably needs someone from MS to do (or at least check, I'm not a great C++ programmer).",
