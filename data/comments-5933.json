        "body": "@deischi Thanks for your feedback. The adapter index as defined in the `OrtSessionOptionsAppendExecutionProvider_DML` function is guaranteed to point to the same device until the next adapter change event occurs upon which the DXGIFactory object will need to be recreated with the new set of adapters enumerated. The app should register for the [adapter change event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi1_6/nf-dxgi1_6-idxgifactory7-registeradapterschangedevent) and react to the event appropriately. Please take a look at this [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/blob/master/Samples/Desktop/D3D12xGPU/src/D3D12xGPU.cpp) for more detail.\r\n\r\nWhen an adapter is removed, the subsequent calls to DXGI and Direct3D on the device created from the removed adapter will also fail with DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED failure code. This means that if the chosen adapter is removed during the call to `OrtSessionOptionsAppendExecutionProvider_DML`, the function would likely fail. However, you might still want to double check if the chosen adapter index still maps to the expected Luid after a successful call just to be sure. Take a look at `QueryForAdapterEnumerationChanges` and `ValidateActiveAdapter` method in the sample code for the idea.\r\n",
