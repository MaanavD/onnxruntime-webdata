        "body": "Hi @yaxili96 . OpenVINO now has the functionality to support onnx models with Weights saved in external files.\r\n\r\n**Reference:**\r\nhttps://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_IE_DG_ONNX_Support.html#:~:text=Weights%20saved%20in%20external%20files%3A\r\n\r\nso we should be able to expose this feature in OpenVINO Execution Provider for ONNXRuntime. Also, if you refer to above openvino documentation page, it has some catch.\r\n\r\n> **Paths to external weight files are saved in an ONNX model; these paths are relative to the model's directory path. It means that if a model is located at: home/user/workspace/models/model.onnx and a file that contains external weights: home/user/workspace/models/data/weights.bin the path saved in model should be: data/weights.bin.**\r\n\r\nSo make sure when you are trying to Converting and Saving an ONNX Model to External Data, you adhere to the rule above.\r\nYou can use this onnx api to convert an ONNX model to external data.\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/ExternalData.md#converting-and-saving-an-onnx-model-to-external-data\r\n\r\n**How can you test this feature out with onnxrt-openvino Execution Provider:**\r\nBuild OpenVINO Execution Provider for ONNXRuntime with the latest OpenVINO 2021.4 Version. Build onnxrt from Master.\r\n\r\nPlease comment out the following section of the code. (L51 to L57)\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/60c98a86b7f0deb2bbb9f9ca8ab5d14e2fc383e7/onnxruntime/core/providers/openvino/ov_versions/capability.cc#L51\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29036417/132123386-cd00cf3b-3569-4dc7-83cb-77ef0244a428.png)\r\n\r\nRe-compile and then test out the feature and then let us know if this addresses your request. \r\n\r\nIf the feature works, we will incorporate this change officially in our upcoming openvino Execution Provider release in october.\r\n\r\n**PS:** I tried this with yolov4 model from onnx model zoo and with above changes, I was able to use openvino execution provider with an onnx model having external weights.\r\n\r\n",
