I guess for your model, when you were using Tensorrt Execution provider, it still had some nodes running on CUDA (because TensorRT not support). e.g. InputX -> NodeA (NodeA running on CUDA), in this case, the memory binding for InputX should use CUDA memory allocator instead of TensorRT one. Could you share your model so that we can investigate it further?\r\nBy the way, we are trying to unify the memory allocators for CUDA & TensorRT, how we can fix this soon.",
