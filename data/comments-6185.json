If yes what is the approach then to serve a model for prediction requests (similar to Tensorflow Serving) ? If it's deprecated it might make sense to clearly document this so that people won't dive into ONNX Runtime server and avoid following a wrong path.\r\n\r\nHere https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/dockerfiles/README.md ONNX Runtime Server is mentioned as well and no indication it's deprecated.",
