Can we verify ONNX's original intention (because the Lp norm for p=1 is well defined in math to include that `abs` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space#Lp_spaces), whereas PyTorch (and kin) appears to be using a different definition of \"power-average pooling\"? Are there are frameworks that use that `abs` in their LP pooling?\r\n\r\n(The ONNX spec really *should* include the formula and decompositions for every operator in documentation, and it needs to have test cases with both negative and positive values. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)",
