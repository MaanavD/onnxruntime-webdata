        "body": "@daquexian : ONNX spec does not clearly specify whether to treat missing element type same as element type set to 0 .i.e. undefined or different. However both ONNX and ONNXRuntime treat them as being different. Moreover the IR does specify that -\r\n\r\n\"The number of inputs and outputs in a node, their types, the set of attributes specified in a node **and their types MUST satisfy the constraints imposed by the signature of the nodeâ€™s operator**.\"\r\nand by this definition the current behavior seems right in that it is raising an error because the inferred type int64_t for node ConstantOfShape does not match type UNDEFINED. In order words undefinied is not a valid type for this op and hence the error.\r\n\r\n@gramalingam for comments.",
