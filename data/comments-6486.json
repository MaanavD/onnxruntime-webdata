        "body": "Hi @skottmckay, thank you for the fix.\r\nRegarding the issues:\r\n- You can build ArmNN separately following https://github.com/ARM-software/armnn/blob/branches/armnn_20_11/BuildGuideCrossCompilation.md. Here should be a more updated version of the documentation.\r\n- Most of our tests used a cross-toolchain for the cross-compilation step. ACL and ArmNN libraries are present in the toolchain and the custom paths are not needed. The option was added for the cases when the libraries are from a different version. It could be that we did not see that. Other thing would be that ArmNN EP does not necessary need ACL if the library is not linked dynamic, which was the case some time ago. That means that the ACL library was integrated inside ArmNN and we did not need the extra step. This did not affect the build in any sense, but it was to specify if you use an external library or not.\r\n- We used link_library because in some instances, the cross-toolchain would not see them if not stated otherwise.\r\n- Regarding the gemm function, like other instances, there are some files in the ACL and ArmNN EP that use CPU EP files for fallback operations in case the ONNX Runtime execute functions more generic than ACL and ArmNN could provide. This means that some changes in the CPU files path will affect the paths in those.",

Is that not intentional? \r\n\r\nAny feedback on how the ONNX proto file should be processed? If you're building with ORT I would expect you'd want to use the version of ONNX that ORT is using instead of an arbitrary commit id from your build instructions. Is that correct? And if so, how should one resolve the discrepancy that ArmNN is using full protobuf and ORT is using protobuf-lite by default? \r\n",

Regarding include paths, i do not know, inside of ONNX Runtime, to be files in ArmNN EP that needs ACL headers. If you found any such problems, it could be from the ACL library linkage. Then again, we used the environment that already links both set of headers by default so it could be a corner-case here.\r\n\r\nAs for protobuf, the recommendations were to build the ArmNN library without the parsers and protobuf supports. This means that that library would not be used on its own outside ONNX Runtime, but the discrepancy would disappear. ",
