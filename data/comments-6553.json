        "body": "Well it'll make everything load properly. Windows' behaviour with `deleteOnExit` is a pain for Java code which unpacks dlls at runtime, but there isn't much to be done about it unless we have direct control of the unloading code. I'll need to make equivalent modifications to the Java loader for the other libraries that have shared providers, and I'm still a little worried about the way it loads things inside the native code because it's not clear to me that it's pulling things in from the right path, but if it's working then presumably the platform dynamic loader is figuring it out.\r\n\r\nDid you test the Java/CUDA bits on both Windows & Linux? I guess I'll need to test DNNL on macOS as well, as that could also have different behaviour.",
