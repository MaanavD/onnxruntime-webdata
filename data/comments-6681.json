We seem to be using an `std::unordered_map` to store a mapping of keys to values - https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/33279250b57764bd65487ea91a4f92d576e03c20/onnxruntime/core/providers/cpu/ml/label_encoder.h#L101. AFAIK - for associative containers in c++, `NaN`s are not valid keys. We probably have to move to a data structure like a Trie to do efficient bit-wise comparison based lookups to be compliant with the ONNX spec.",
