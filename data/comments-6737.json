        "body": "The `Loop` operator isn't added by ORT. It is because `Range` is a function based operator in ONNX and ORT simply \"expands\"  the subgraph associated with the function and places it in the actual node's place while loading up the model and making sure it plays well with the other components in the graph as a \"sanity check\".\r\n\r\nNow, `Range`'s inputs need to be scalars (and not 1D tensors of shape [1]) as per the spec. I wonder if the Mul's output which is feeding into one of Range's inputs has a shape which is actually [1]. Could you try squeezing that out and see if the model loads fine ? All this is to simply get past model loading, eventually ORT will use the Range kernel for compute purposes.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9969784/108315570-73eb2c00-7170-11eb-9744-ee7baa926f21.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeally, the Range operator's shape inference should probably add a check at the beginning of its function body to ensure they are scalars and provide a clear message instead of it surfacing something weird like this.",
