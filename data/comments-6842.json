My understanding of the raspberrypi OS distributions is that the rpi3 is usually on a 32-bit install, and the rpi4 has a 64-bit option (though both processors support 64-bit ARM).\r\n\r\nI've not tried to cross-compile the Java bits, so I'm not sure how well it will work. The Java cmake configuration uses the same platform detection logic as the rest of ORT so I'm not sure why it's not picking up that it's supposed to be doing a 64-bit compile.",

        "body": "So that's failing to find a library which CMake thinks you need but you don't (and so can be patched around) and one that you do. You don't need `JAVA_AWT_LIBRARY`, so it looks like the workaround for that is to put `set(JAVA_AWT_LIBRARY NotNeeded)` in the onnxruntime_java.cmake file before the call to `findPackage(JNI REQUIRED)`. However we do need `JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY` and it's hard to say why it couldn't find it especially as it was in the other image.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not really sure what will fix that as I don't know enough about those images, but `JAVA_AWT_LIBRARY` will appear when you install a desktop environment (or at least it did on Ubuntu Server as I hit the same issue yesterday), and maybe that will fix the missing `JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY` too. This is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, as you definitely don't need it to build it, but it's hard to say what a more minimal solution is.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could completely specify the path to those libraries before the CMake `FindPackage(JNI REQUIRED)` call. libawt.so should be in `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-aarch64/jre/lib/amd64` and libjvm.so should be in `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-aarch64/jre/lib/amd64/server`.",
