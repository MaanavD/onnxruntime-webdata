The missing link between `2799_Add_quant` and `Relu 2763` was the only one I could find, and with that fixed the model runs successfully.\r\n\r\nI don't think this should be tagged as `quantization` because the model I supplied to the quantizer was not topologically sorted in the first place, which violates onnx spec. As for how I obtained that non-topologically sorted model, I think that was a bug in one of the pre-processing transformation scripts I had written.",
