        "body": "Nice!\r\n\r\nAlso, I found finally they added versioning support. https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/take-control-of-your-vcpkg-dependencies-with-versioning-support/ That was really a blocking issue for us. If without it,  Let's say  if we put onnxruntime there, but later on protobuf gets a version that breaks onnxruntime build, what should we do? We can't publish a new release immediately just because Google protobuf did so. This was my main concern. \r\n\r\n> Allow for submodules to be optional\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem is how to handling ONNX.  ONNX Runtime is not using a release version of ONNX.  Can vcpkg accept such an ONNX package?\r\n\r\n> Submodule binaries must be picked up using find_package, find_library\r\nIf no submodule exists, that's fine. Otherwise, what if your system already installed protobuf, when you building onnxruntime which protobuf would be used , the one in submodule or the system installed one? It would be very confused. \r\n\r\n> Export standard cmake-config/cmake-target files for easier find_package(onnxruntime) support\r\n\r\nSorry I don't know how to do that. Welcome to contribute!\r\n\r\n",
