I just deleted it before I put the code here.\r\nI used time.time() to check the code ```ort_outs = ort_session.run([], ort_inputs) ``` and ```torch_out = model(left, right) ``` on pytorch. That's why I got the value 2.5 sec and 14 sec.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the converting is not including in the timing. the timing is only for one line. Sorry, the code is a little bit messy since we did many tests to see why the speed is so slow. \r\n",
