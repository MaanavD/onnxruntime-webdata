        "body": "Do you have an Android application ready for the integration of Onnx Runtime for mobile inference? \r\nSince the actual integration of Onnx Runtime Mobile is highly dependable on your actual application and the language you use, you will have to convert the python script to either c/c++ or java/kotlin.\r\n\r\nTo use Onnx Runtime c/c++ API,\r\n- See examples of using c/c++ API here, https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/samples/c_cxx\r\n- Also you may want to check the [Android NDK samples](https://github.com/android/ndk-samples) on how to integrate native libraries in your Android App, to be more specific, look at this particular sample app, https://github.com/android/ndk-samples/tree/main/hello-libs\r\n- Here is an example app running MobileNet v2 using Onnx Runtime c++ API, https://github.com/Rohithkvsp/OnnxRuntimeAndorid\r\n\r\nTo use Onnx Runtime java/kotlin API,\r\n- See examples of using java API here, https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/java/src/test/java/sample\r\n- Also you may want to check this sample Android App here, https://github.com/gwang-msft/ort_image_classification_android, which integrates MobileNet v1 in an Android image classification App using kotlin\r\n",
