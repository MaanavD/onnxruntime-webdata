If it is in the shape inference function, the fix needs to go into the ONNX repo, if the kernel needs a fix then it goes into the ORT repo.\r\n\r\nAFAIK- you do not need any special permissions to send out a PR. You' ll most probably have to fork this repo, make your change in a  branch and send out a PR into master of this repo. That should be all to the best of my knowledge.\r\n",
