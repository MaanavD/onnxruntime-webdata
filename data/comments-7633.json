Something wrong in the memory planner.\r\n\r\nPlease see the graph below.\r\n\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/856316/117767995-8f515a80-b1e6-11eb-9289-fdd8d0e051aa.png)\r\n\r\n\"Unsqueeze\" and \"Cast\" operators can be done in-place. So our planner thinks the Cast_2 node on the bottom can use the same output tensor as the Cast node on the top. However, if the graph executes in an order of:\r\n1. Cast\r\n2. Unsqueeze\r\n3. Cast_2\r\n4. Slice\r\n\r\nThen the Slice op will get wrong input data. It didn't happen in sequential  execution mode because probably somehow the sequential  planner carefully avoided such an execution sequence.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
