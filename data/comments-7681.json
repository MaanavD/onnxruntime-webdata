        "body": "Hi, @dedoogong,\r\n\r\nThose warnings are useful for debugging performance issue. There's no way to configure it yet.\r\nThe warnings are consistent with what we current supported:\r\nonnxruntime/core/providers/cuda/cuda_execution_provider.cc\r\nThat's why when you switch opset, you are getting different warnings. Officially, begin with opset12 would be good choice, but I can see pad is still in 11, and we don't have DepthToSpace yet. \r\n\r\nI am tagging your issue for future considerations. (add @SherlockNoMad)",
