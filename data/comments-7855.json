The latest version of Windows available does not support domain_version 13 and so you see that the model is not able to load correctly. In the next version of the Windows OS, opset support will be bumped up to be more current.\r\n\r\nTake a look at https://www.onnxruntime.ai/python/. These bindings will enable you to evaluate against the same core engine ONNX runtime that WinML uses as well, but it includes the latest opset support.",
