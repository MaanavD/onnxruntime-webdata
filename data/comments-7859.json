[(here)](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks?hl=zh-cn)\r\nBesides, my two .ort models [(here)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dgYtOjXmoOO6AQhri16xHYjp2G61uOzz) converted from .onnx with --nnapi have no  improvement compared to cpu execution backend(even the pyramidmobiledensemotionfastdirect256sim_nnapi_basic model is slower than cpu backend), but the operators in my models are in the list(android developers-ndk nnapi list). \r\nThanks.",
