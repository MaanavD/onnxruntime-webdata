        "body": "Closing this as spec is unclear as to how to handle cases when pad size >= kernel size. When pad size >= kernel size, atleast one value in the output tensor will be generated from a \"pure padding region\". Raised an issue in ONNX to clarify the correct functionality (or if it is even allowed in the first place) - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/1922. Since there is tracked separately in the place it should be, will close this issue as it is not actionable for the time being.  ",
