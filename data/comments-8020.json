But I got the same error with the real input in the converted ONNX model, and if not exactly the same, it was still about an axis dimension mismatch.\r\n\r\nIt'll be difficult for me to share a sample image, as the input image goes through a lot of pre-processing before going into the model with appropriate input dimensions. Also, as it's a multi-input model, there are different inputs like the anchors and meta data along with the image.\r\n\r\nWhat if instead of passing zero arrays, you randomly populate the inputs with garbage values?",

We had the exact same scenario a while back with a Mask RCNN model exported from PyTorch that was basically failing a node for inputs that had 0 detections. Unfortunately, ORT can't do too much about these node execution failures if it violates the ONNX spec (like in this case, we are concatenating inputs in which the non-concat axes' dim values differed - this is a direct violation of the ONNX spec for the Concat operator). It is upto the model to handle such cases more gracefully and exit the graph prior to such nodes. When we bought this up to the Torch exporter group at that time, they had acknowledged this and said they will account for this in future.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why we strongly feel that we require a \"real\" image producing (at-least one) detection to even investigate (even then, the issue could still be one of conversion/export but atleast it is more concrete to go on than garbage data/np.zeros()). \r\n  ",

This seems to be somewhat troublesome in my case. Did you suffer something similar ? \r\n\r\n<img width=\"490\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-08-11 at 1 57 02 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46529961/128996112-72bf8205-97e9-4558-aa0f-8ba8ede0b1eb.png\">\r\n\r\nThanks and Regards\r\n",
