It's better but still worse than PyTorch inference.\r\n\r\nGPU Results with bs=1:\r\n\r\n> Device cuda:0\r\n> Batch size 1\r\n> Batch amount 100\r\n> 100 ort_session.run took 4.1152403\r\n\r\nGPU Results with bs=16:\r\n\r\n> Device cuda:0\r\n> Batch size 16\r\n> Batch amount 100\r\n> 100 ort_session.run took 57.0434766\r\n\r\nAn interesting thing: I did similar (correct time measurement with IOBinding scenario 3, warm up, extended optimization level) to [an example from PyTorch Docs](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html) (where PyTorch was faster for me too) and get nearly the same results on GPU for Pytorch and ORT (ORT ~5% faster).\r\nSo, maybe this is due to the \"unfortunate\" combination of hardware and network architecture?",
