        "body": "@ghweber Thanks for reporting this issue. It looks like the PYTHONINTERP_FOUND variable is not set anymore in the build flow and therefore the right pyxir location isn't found. I submitted a PR with a fix for this, which replaces PYTHONINTERP_FOUND with Python_EXECUTABLE: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/8631 . ",
