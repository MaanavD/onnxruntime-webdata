Log severity is the general log level and log verbosity is a finer-grained level that only applies to the VERBOSE log severity in debug builds.\r\n\r\nFor example, see these C API functions:\r\n[SetSessionLogSeverityLevel](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/api/c/struct_ort_api.html#ac364c1ca9e610962ba96c37112a36d3e)\r\n[SetSessionLogVerbosityLevel](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/api/c/struct_ort_api.html#ac346615876bbc53dc8aaf17acfe36b94)\r\n\r\nSome things to consider:\r\nHow do the environment variables interact with the other ways of setting the log levels? At what scopes do they apply? What precedence do they have?\r\n\r\nSome places to start looking:\r\nLogging code:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/include/onnxruntime/core/common/logging\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/onnxruntime/core/common/logging\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/28ce2a5a785804d6244d78274c6fbbda06f48b57/onnxruntime/core/common/logging/logging.cc#L84\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/28ce2a5a785804d6244d78274c6fbbda06f48b57/onnxruntime/core/common/logging/logging.cc#L148\r\n\r\nC API (used to implement some other language APIs):\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/include/onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_c_api.h\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_c_api.cc\r\n\r\nPython API (implemented independently of the C API):\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/python/onnxruntime_pybind_state.cc\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest in contributing. Feel free to discuss and ask questions here.",
