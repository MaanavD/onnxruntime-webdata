        "body": "Thanks for the feedback. Consuming ORT in C++ for Web is an important scenario. We need to figure out how and update documents accordingly.\r\n\r\nSome rough ideas:\r\n\r\n- use dynamic linking: create `onnxruntime.so` for web and use Emscripten's [dynamic linking feature (experimental)](https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Building-Projects.html#dynamic-linking).\r\n\r\n- use static linking: create `onnxruntime.a` for web. This file will be used in link phrase of a c++ web assembly project.\r\n\r\nI haven't try either way yet, as my current focus is still on consuming from JavaScript side. But I will revisit this issue when I got some time.",
