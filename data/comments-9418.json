        "body": "@skottmckay Thank you very much! I have now found out that this is a problem with the model‘s OPs and has nothing to do with its version. But I can load it successfully when I first use the old version v1.1.2 with ONNX Opset 11. So I tried to upgrade the version gradually and found:\r\n\r\n1. use v1.1.2 --> Loading successfully.\r\n2. use v1.2.0 --> `[ONNXRuntimeError] : 2 : INVALID_ARGUMENT : Failed to load model with error: Unknown model file format version.`\r\n3. use v1.3.0 -->`[ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : Fatal error: CropAndResize is not a registered function/op`\r\n4. use v1.4.0 -->`[ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : Fatal error: CropAndResize is not a registered function/op`\r\n5. use v1.5.2 and later versions keep the same error message with the latest v1.9.0.\r\n\r\nIt seems like ORT doesn't support custom op since v1.3.0？ And my ONNX is converted from Keras2.2.0+Tensorflow1.8.0 with CUDA9.0/Cudnn7.0，but now I want to use CUDA11.4/Cudnn8.0 to run it ,do you think this is the reason for this problem? Must the loading environment of onnx be similar to its generation environment?\r\n",
