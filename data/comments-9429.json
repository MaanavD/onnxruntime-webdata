        "body": "After much confusion on my part I've finally managed to get identical answers back out from an SVM trained using Tribuo in LibSVM and the same model exported into ONNX and scored via ONNX Runtime. I'm a little uncomfortable with relying on unspecified behaviour, but assuming the ONNX spec is fixed to codify what ORT does then it'll be fine.\r\n\r\nThe code is [here](https://github.com/Craigacp/tribuo/blob/libsvm-onnx/Classification/LibSVM/src/main/java/org/tribuo/classification/libsvm/LibSVMClassificationModel.java#L250), though it'll change slightly once we finish merging in a couple of larger refactors of how we emit ONNX models from Java. The voting logic was a straight translation of how sklearn2onnx works, but in the binary non-probabilistic case I had to multiply it by negative one first. I can see that in the sklearn2onnx code as well, but it's very confusing that it's necessary and I'm unclear if that's going to be part of the ONNX spec or if it's quirk of ORT. We have a gather on the end to make sure the output lines up with Tribuo's indices, rather than LibSVM's indices as those are not necessarily the same.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help.",
