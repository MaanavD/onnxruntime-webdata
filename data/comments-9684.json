Is it the com.microsoft.onnxruntime:onnxruntime build or another one?\r\n- How was the OrtSession constructed?\r\n- How were the inputs to the crashing run call constructed?\r\n- What model are you using (if it's internal what's the rough structure and input shapes)?\r\n- Is the crash immediate or only with some inputs?\r\n\r\nAlso if possible can you rebuild ORT with debug symbols and then re-run it?",
