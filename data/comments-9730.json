We found that the workspace memory could jump up by GBs when CuDNN is picking the best possible Conv algo. This did not play well with our allocator setup and this was a learning for us and we had to pull out that change that was prompted by your issue.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, this change added it back: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/8613 but we had to gate the algo picking functionality as it seems with it turned on, it improves the perf of your models but causes regressions in some others. So, we need to expose the flag for users to turn it on while inferencing. You can set [this line](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/ac57afc3a69dfc6a57caeee678966a1fce50bca9/onnxruntime/core/providers/cuda/cuda_execution_provider.h#L85) to return true (by default it is returning false) and build from source if you need it for now.

        "body": "@vadimkantorov: The regression in 1.8.1 was expected as we reverted the change because it caused a memory bloat (It wasn't missed due to lack of benchmarks). To re-introduce the change, we had to re-architect our memory allocation setup for CUDA. \r\n\r\nI just realized though, the flag to use the maximum possible workspace isn't available in C/C++/C# but it is available in Python as the provider options is just a map. See this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/7e207ba3be3620ffbb9f8b8fcffd15e911a744e3/orttraining/orttraining/python/training/ortmodule/_graph_execution_manager.py#L268\r\n\r\nIf you use Python, you could pass in the provider option to turn the feature ON. See this for an example on how to use the provider options map:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/ac57afc3a69dfc6a57caeee678966a1fce50bca9/onnxruntime/test/python/onnxruntime_test_python.py#L154\r\n",
