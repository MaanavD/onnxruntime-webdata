I think all the programs requiring the GPU resources get affected if the GPU is busy as I have tested two instances of my inferencing app at the same time and each of them speeds down.\r\n\r\nBut the impact of this case is far less than the Unity's impact to the inference time. What i want to do is to integrate my inference dll to the Unity, in this case, the inference time would increase several times.",
