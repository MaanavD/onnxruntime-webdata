        "body": "It means SoftmaxGrad is executed as a single operator as ORT has `a specialized kernel for this op`. This error message can be pretty mis-leading... We have a function body definition for SoftmaxGrad in opset 13 and SoftmaxGrad in opset 12 (or older) doesn't have function body. However, in both cases, the input number is always 2, so I think this error message is not correct. Maybe it should say\r\n```\r\n[Warning] Cannot find function expansion for SoftmaxGrad.\r\n```\r\n@gramalingam, is my understanding correct? I am trying to come up with a fix, so any comments are very welcome.\r\n\r\n[Update] The root location of this exception is\r\n```\r\nFunctionImpl::FunctionImpl\r\n    Graph::Resolve\r\n\t    Graph::PerformTypeAndShapeInferencing\r\n\t\t    Graph::VerifyNodeAndOpMatch\r\n\t\t\t    checker::check_node\r\n```\r\nIn addition to traditional single operator definition, `SoftmaxGrad` has a composite definition using primitives in opset version 13. When the containing graph specifies opset version to 12, the `checker::check_node` will fail because in opset 12, `Squeeze` has only 1 input but in opset 13, `Squeeze` has 2 inputs. I think it will be better to make ORT throwing this exception earlier with a clear message.\r\n",
