It's very useful.\r\nI run through the code and found fused matmul and the time-(in)dependent phases but didn't see the partitionings, are they implemented in sgemm kernels provided by mlas library (in `MlasSgemmTryMultithread` )? Also, is there any plan to add weight centric streamlining to onnxruntime to make it a full-fledged deepcpu implementation?\r\n",
